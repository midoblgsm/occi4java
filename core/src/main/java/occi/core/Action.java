/**
 * Action is an OCCI base type. Represent an invocable operation on a Entity
 * sub-type instance or collection thereof.
 * 
 * The Action type is an abstract type. Each sub-type of Action defines an
 * invocable operation applicable to an Entity sub-type instance or a collection
 * thereof. In general, Actions modify state by, for example, performing complex
 * operation such as rebooting a virtual machine.
 * 
 * An Action MUST always bound to either a Kind or a Mixin instance through a
 * composite association. An Action is considered to be a capability of the Kind
 * or Mixin instance it is associated with. [T. Metsch, A. Edmonds, R. Nyren and
